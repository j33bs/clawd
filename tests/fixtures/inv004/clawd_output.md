1) Preserve append-only truth: every decision must be logged with who/when/why.
2) Keep memo small, but require explicit uncertainty notes for contested assumptions.

4) If reviewer outcomes differ, gate status is unresolved and cannot be promoted.
5) Non-goal: optimizing throughput at the expense of interpretability.
6) Brevity constraint accepted; accountability language is mandatory.
