# Memory Maintenance Guide

## Purpose
This guide outlines the contemporary best practices for maintaining memory files and ensuring effective information retention and organization.

## Daily Practices
- Create/update daily memory file (YYYY-MM-DD.md) with significant events
- Capture decisions, learnings, and important context
- Tag information that might be valuable for long-term retention
- Clean up temporary notes that aren't needed long-term

## Weekly Review Process
1. Review the past 7 days of daily logs
2. Identify information that should be promoted to MEMORY.md
3. Consolidate related topics and themes
4. Remove outdated or irrelevant information
5. Update MEMORY.md with distilled insights

## Monthly Audit
- Review MEMORY.md for outdated information
- Reorganize sections for better clarity
- Archive old daily logs if needed (though they're typically small enough to keep)
- Assess effectiveness of current memory practices

## Information Hierarchy
1. **Transient**: Information needed only for current session (keep in working memory)
2. **Short-term**: Information needed for days to weeks (daily logs)
3. **Long-term**: Information needed indefinitely (MEMORY.md)

## Curation Guidelines
- Be selective about what moves from daily logs to long-term memory
- Focus on actionable insights rather than detailed logs
- Maintain consistent formatting for easier retrieval
- Regular pruning of outdated information

## Security Considerations
- Never expose personal information unnecessarily
- Ensure memory files remain local to the workspace
- Regular backup of important memory files
- Proper access controls on memory directory

## Tools for Memory Maintenance
- Use `memory_search` and `memory_get` tools for efficient retrieval
- Leverage file system organization for quick access
- Consider automated cleanup for very old temporary information
