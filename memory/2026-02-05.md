## What Happened

Major system overhaul via Claude Code session. Heath's OpenClaw agent (Clawd) was causing a keystroke storm — rapid uncontrolled keystrokes firing globally across all macOS apps when the agent was asked to test a calendar integration.

### Root Cause
- HEARTBEAT.md contained executable tasks firing every 30 minutes
- AGENTS.md told the agent to "Be Proactive!" during heartbeats
- Qwen model hit 429 rate limits and retried rapidly
- A disconnected JS compliance engine gave a false sense of governance

### Fixes Applied
1. **Heartbeat disabled** — HEARTBEAT.md emptied, `heartbeat.every: "0m"` in openclaw.json
2. **SOUL.md rewritten** — 7 constitutional principles embedded directly in system prompt
3. **AGENTS.md rewritten** — removed "Be Proactive!", added operational boundaries and rate-limit stop rules
4. **Constitution JS files archived** — compliance_engine.js was disconnected from runtime, moved to archive/
5. **100+ files organised** — from workspace root into notes/, reference/, scripts/, archive/
6. **USER.md populated** — Heath's profile from MEMORY.md
7. **IDENTITY.md populated** — Clawd, AI familiar, 🐾
8. **MEMORY.md fixed** — corrected hardware (Apple M2), trimmed bloat
9. **BOOTSTRAP.md deleted** — per OpenClaw docs ("delete after first run")
10. **Anthropic API key configured** — moved to anthropic:default profile
11. **Task routing configured** — Qwen primary → Opus for coding → Claude Code as fallback
12. **Security hardening** — .zshrc permissions fixed (600), burned Apple password scrubbed from git history, .gitignore enhanced, 13 backup config files with plaintext tokens removed

### Current State
- Gateway running, Telegram connected
- Qwen primary, Claude Opus for coding (/model opus), Claude Code as credit fallback
- Heartbeat disabled
- Git repo clean, no secrets in history
- Ready for first real conversation via Telegram
