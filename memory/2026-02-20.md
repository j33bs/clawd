## Morning
- Worked on configuring Router for OAuth tokens
- Updated `policy_router.py` to resolve OAuth tokens from `auth.json` for OpenAI-compatible providers
- Created venv at `workspace/venv` and installed `requests` library (was missing)

## Afternoon
- Tested TeamChat with OAuth config
- **Result:** Router finds token (length 1879) but OpenAI returns **401 Unauthorized**
- This confirms the token is being sent, but rejected by `api.openai.com` endpoint
- Likely cause: OAuth JWT requires different endpoint than standard `api.openai.com/v1`

## Evening
- Summarized status for user:
  1. Router OAuth implementation: Complete
  2. TeamChat: Blocked by 401 auth error
  3. Next steps: Switch to Minimax (working) or fix OpenAI endpoint

## Technical Notes
- `policy_router.py` changes: Added `_ai_oauth_tokenresolve_open()` and modified `_resolve_provider_api_key()`
- OAuth token source: `openai-codex` profile from `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth.json`
- TeamChat uses `openai_gpt52_chat` provider via "use chatgpt" trigger
