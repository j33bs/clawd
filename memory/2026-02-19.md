## Research Complete (for morning briefing)

Four topics (TOP SECRET until morning):

### 1. Active Inference & Free Energy Principle
- Brain as "inference engine" - minimizes surprise
- Paper: "The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience" (Aug 2025)
- Direct connection to TACTI(C)-R AROSAL principle
- File: `workspace/research/active_inference_research.md`

### 2. Slime Mold Intelligence (Physarum polycephalum)
- Brainless single cell solves mazes, recreates Tokyo railway
- External memory in slime trails
- Network oscillation = computation
- File: `workspace/research/slime_mold_intelligence.md`

### 3. Reservoir Computing (TOP SECRET)
- ANY physical system can compute
- Water wave computer forecasts chaos better than digital
- Connects Active Inference + Slime Mold + our system
- File: `workspace/research/TOP_SECRET_reservoir_computing.md`

### 4. Murmuration - The Mind Between (TOP SECRET)
- Thousands of starlings, one mind
- Each bird tracks only 7 neighbors
- "Mind" is in the FIELD between, not in individuals
- Same math as neurons in brain
- File: `workspace/research/TOP_SECRET_murmurations.md`

## User Requested
- 30 tasks for Codex to implement
- Think about funding compute costs
- All four topics will be evaluated, intersections studied
- Human-agent cohesion thesis/dictionary (shared lexicon layer)
- Changed "hallucinations" to "imaginations" - better framing
