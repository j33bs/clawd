ATOMIC HABITS by James Clear
========================================

"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

"Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations."

"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement."

"1% better every day. You'll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year."

"The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas."

"Focus on the overall system, rather than a single goal. True long-term thinking is goal-less."

"If you want better results, forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead."
