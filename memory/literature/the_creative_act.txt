THE CREATIVE ACT by Rick Rubin
========================================

"Creativity is not a rare ability. It is not difficult to access. Creativity is a fundamental aspect of being human."

"We all engage in this process. Regardless of whether or not we're formally making art, we are all living as artists."

"To live as an artist is a way of being in the world. A way of perceiving. A way of being."

"We are all antennae for creative thought."

"The artist is not in charge of the creative process. We are being conducted."

"Every manifestation of this unfolding is doing its own work on behalf of the universe, each in its own way."

"Art is our portal to the unseen world."

"Without the spiritual component, the artist works with a crucial disadvantage."

"Material for our work surrounds us at every turn. It's woven into conversation, nature, chance encounters, and existing works of art."
