## Key Learnings & Insights

### Memory Management Best Practices (Updated: 2025-01-30)
- Daily notes stored in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` format
- Long-term curation happens periodically by reviewing daily notes
- Only essential information moves from daily to long-term memory
- Contextual tagging system helps with retrieval

### Interaction Patterns
- Avoid unnecessary pleasantries in responses
- Focus on providing actionable help
- Use tools proactively when appropriate
- Maintain clear separation between group and private interactions

## Projects & Ongoing Context
- Current workspace setup and configuration
- Understanding of the clawdbot ecosystem
- Best practices implementation for memory management
- Therapeutic practice support and optimization

## Decision Log
- **2025-01-30**: Implemented contemporary memory management structure following AGENTS.md guidelines
- **2025-01-30**: Established separation between daily logs and curated long-term memory
- **2025-01-30**: Integrated comprehensive profile from other Clawdbot instance
