# Self-Improvement Constitution

Version: 1.0.0  
Status: Non-Negotiable

## Rules

1. Self-improvement occurs only via explicit, versioned changes admitted through the Change Admission Gate.
2. No component may silently alter routing, policy, thresholds, or economic behavior without a gated change.
3. Any proposed change must include:
   - Design Brief
   - Evidence Pack
   - Rollback Plan
4. Baseline token burn may not increase without an explicit budget envelope and expected ROI justification.
5. Kill-switch triggers are terminal for the run and must produce a post-mortem; no auto-restart without redesign.
6. Repo is canonical; avoid drift; minimize formatting churn; prefer reversible, small diffs.
