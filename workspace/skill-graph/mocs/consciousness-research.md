# Consciousness Research MOC

This MOC maps the major theories of consciousness and their intersections.

## The Big Three Theories

### 1. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Consciousness = Integrated Information (Φ)
- Measures: How much "more" a system is than sum of parts
- Key: Φ > 0 = conscious
- [[integrated-information-theory]]

### 2. Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT)
- Consciousness = Global broadcasting
- Key: Information access = consciousness
- [[global-neuronal-workspace]]

### 3. Predictive Processing / Active Inference
- Consciousness = Prediction error minimization
- Key: Brain as prediction machine
- [[active-inference]]

## The Intersections

### IWMT: Integrated World Modeling Theory
Combines: IIT + GNWT + FEP + Active Inference
Attempts to solve the "hard problem" through unified framework

### The 2025 Adversarial Test
Nature paper testing GNWT vs IIT empirically:
- Both make different predictions
- First rigorous experimental comparison
- Results pending

## Key Intersections

| A | B | Intersection |
|---|---|---|
| IIT | GNWT | IWMT (Integrated World Modeling Theory) |
| Active Inference | Predictive Coding | Hierarchical Bayesian Brain |
| HTM | Sleep | Memory Consolidation |
| Embodied Cognition | World Models | Physical AI |

## Research Directions

1. **Testing on LLMs**: Can transformer architectures have Φ?
2. **Multi-Agent Consciousness**: Does group-level consciousness emerge?
3. **Temporal Consciousness**: How do we experience time flow?

## TACTI(C)-R Connection

- **AGENCY**: IIT-style integration
- **AROUSAL**: Predictive processing
- **TEMPORALITY**: HTM, temporal windows
