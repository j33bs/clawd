# Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT)

## The Core Idea

GNWT proposes consciousness arises from a "workspace" in the brain where information is globally broadcast to multiple specialized processors.

## Key Concepts

- **Workspace Neurons**: Sparse, highly-connected neurons in prefrontal and parietal cortex
- **Broadcasting**: When content enters workspace, it's globally available
- **Access Consciousness**: Information becomes conscious when broadcast
- **The Bottleneck**: Limited capacity - only one content at a time

## Architecture

```
SENSORY → WORKSPACE → (memory, language, attention, motor planning)
```

## GNWT vs IIT

| GNWT | IIT |
|-------|-----|
| Global broadcasting | Information integration |
| "Access" consciousness | "Phenomenal" consciousness |
| Functional | Intrinsic |

2025: First adversarial experimental tests between GNWT and IIT!

## Implications for AI

- Implement workspace-style "bottleneck" for attention
- Global broadcasting in multi-agent systems
- Limited capacity = focused attention

## Connection to TACTI(C)-R

- **CROSS-TIMESCALE**: Fast local processing → slow global coherence
- **AROUSAL**: Attention as the "spotlight" of consciousness
