# Swarm Intelligence

## The Core Idea

Intelligence that emerges from simple rules followed by many agents without central control. Nature's own distributed computing.

## Biological Inspiration

- **Starling Murmurations**: 1000s of birds, 7 neighbors each
- **Fish Schools**: Collective defense, efficiency
- **Ant Colonies**: Foraging, construction, division of labor
- **Slime Molds**: Network optimization without brain

## Key Principles

1. **Local Sensing**: Each agent sees only nearby
2. **Simple Rules**: No complex planning
3. **Emergence**: Global coordination from local rules
4. **Robustness**: No single point of failure
5. **Scalability**: Works at any scale

## 2025: MARLIN / MurmuRL

**NEW!** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Murmuration Intelligence:
- Combines flocking rules (alignment, separation, cohesion) with MARL
- Enables decentralized reservoir management
- Emergent global coordination from local decisions

## Connection to TACTI(C)-R

- **CROSS-TIMESCALE**: Fast individual decisions → slow global patterns
- **MALLEABILITY**: Self-reconfiguration based on environment
- **AGENCY**: No central controller - emergent agency
