# Embodied Cognition

## The Core Idea

Cognition isn't just "brain computation" - it's what happens when a body meets a world. Intelligence emerges from sensorimotor interaction.

## Key Concepts

- **Sensorimotor Coupling**: Body ↔ World continuous interaction
- **World Modeling**: Internal models of the body's relationship to environment
- **Enaction**: We don't just perceive - we enact our perception
- **Grounding**: Meanings are grounded in embodied experience

## The Three-Layer Framework (2025)

1. **Multimodal Perception**: Vision, touch, proprioception
2. **World Modeling**: Predictive models of environment + body
3. **Structured Strategies**: Hierarchical planning and reasoning

## Famous Implementations

- **DreamerV3** (Hafner, 2025) - World models for reinforcement learning
- **Gato** (DeepMind, 2022) - Generalist agent
- **DeepMind Genie** - End-to-end learned world models

## Implications for AI

- Agents need bodies (or at least environmental interaction)
- World models are cognitive infrastructure, not just tools
- Physical AI = next frontier

## Connection to TACTI(C)-R

- **MALLEABILITY**: Body adapts to world, world shapes body
- **CROSS-TIMESCALE**: Fast reflexes + slow learning
