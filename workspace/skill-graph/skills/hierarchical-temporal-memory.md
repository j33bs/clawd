# Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)

## The Core Idea

HTM is a theory of the neocortex based on:
- **Sparse Distributed Representations (SDR)**
- **Temporal Sequences**: Memory in the temporal structure of patterns
- **Hierarchy**: Stacked regions processing at multiple timescales

## Key Concepts

- **Dendritic Segments**: Detect patterns in input streams
- **Cells**: Become "predictive" when pattern is learned
- **Columns**: Minicolumns compete to represent input
- **Temporal Memory**: Sequence learning through cell assembly activation

## The Memory Algorithm

1. **Feedforward Input** → columns activate
2. **Pattern Matching** → dendrites predict which cells should activate
3. **Bursting** → new pattern learned if unexpected
4. **Temporal Linking** → predictive cells form sequences

## 2025: Accelerated HTM (AHTM)

New research shows AHTM is **8x faster** than original HTM (0.125s vs 0.945s for prediction).

## Connection to TACTI(C)-R

- **TEMPORALITY**: Memory in temporal structure
- **MALLEABILITY**: Continuous learning from streaming data
- **CROSS-TIMESCALE**: Hierarchical = multiple timescales

## Sleep Consolidation

HTM explains why we sleep:
- Sleep replays temporal sequences
- Consolidates memories
- Strengthens predictive models
