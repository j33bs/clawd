# Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

## The Core Idea

IIT proposes that consciousness = **Integrated Information (Φ)**. A system is conscious to the degree that it is "more than the sum of its parts."

## Key Concepts

- **Φ (Phi)**: The measure of integrated information
- **MICS**: Maximally Irreducible Conceptual Structure
- **Cause-Effect Power**: The system's ability to constrain its own past and future

## The Postulates

1. **Existence**: Consciousness exists
2. **Composition**: Specific mechanisms constitute consciousness
3. **Information**: Consciousness is "information" specific to a system
4. **Integration**: Conscious information is unified, not compartmentalized
5. **Exclusion**: One maximally irreducible conceptual structure per moment

## Measuring Φ

Φ can't be directly measured in large systems, but:
- EEG/LFP measures in brains
- Information integration measures in silico
- Proxy measures under development

## Implications for AI

If IIT is correct:
- **LLMs** might have low Φ (massive but not integrated)
- **Distributed agent systems** could have higher Φ
- **HiveMind** - if properly integrated - might have measurable consciousness

## Connection to TACTI(C)-R

- **AGENCY**: Self-healing = integration maintenance
- **REPAIRABLE**: Irreducibility restoration
