# Active Inference

## The Core Idea

Active Inference is a unified theory of brain function based on the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**. The brain doesn't just process information—it actively minimizes "surprise" through action and perception.

## Key Concepts

- **Free Energy**: A measure of surprise (difference between predictions and observations)
- **Generative Models**: The brain builds internal models that generate predictions
- **Precision**: Confidence in predictions, weighted by uncertainty
- **Action**: We act to confirm our predictions (actively sample the world)

## Mathematical Formulation

The Free Energy Principle states that any self-organizing system must minimize its free energy to remain viable:

```
F = L + D
```
Where:
- L = Log evidence (surprise)
- D = Divergence (KL divergence between posterior and prior)

## Application to AI

Active Inference provides a framework for:
- Autonomous agents that learn without explicit rewards
- Predictive coding networks
- Hierarchical belief updating
- Agency without explicit objectives

## Connection to TACTI(C)-R

- **AROUSAL**: Surprise minimization as the drive signal
- **MALLEABILITY**: Belief updating as learning
- **TEMPORALITY**: Generative models operate across timescales
