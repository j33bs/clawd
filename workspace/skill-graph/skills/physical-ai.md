# Physical AI

## The Core Idea

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that perceive, reason about, and act in the physical world—not just digital environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Real-World Sensing**: Vision, touch, audio, proprioception
- **Actuation**: Motors, grippers, locomotion
- **Closed-Loop**: Continuous perception → action → feedback
- **Embodied Agency**: Acting in world changes future perception

## 2025 Landscape

- **Boston Dynamics**: Advanced locomotion
- **Tesla Optimus**: Humanoid robotics
- **Swarm Robotics**: Collective physical AI
- **Edge AI**: On-device processing for real-time response

## The Physical AI Stack

```
SENSORS → PERCEPTION → WORLD MODEL → PLANNER → CONTROL → ACTUATORS

## Connection to TACTI(C)-R

- **MALLEABILITY**: Physical systems must adapt to terrain, objects, wear
- **REPAIRABLE**: Robots need self-diagnosis and repair
- **AROUSAL**: Energy management critical for mobile systems
