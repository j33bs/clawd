# ChatGPT Response - Circumplex Model

**Question:** What is the circumplex model of emotion? Give me a brief summary.

**Answer:**

The circumplex model, proposed by James A. Russell in 1980, is a dimensional model of affect (emotion) that arranges emotions in a two-dimensional circular space:

1. **Valence (Pleasantness)**: Horizontal axis ranging from negative (unpleasant) to positive (pleasant)
2. **Arousal (Activation)**: Vertical axis ranging from low (calm) to high (active)

This model can represent emotions like:
- High arousal + positive valence = excited, happy
- High arousal + negative valence = anxious, stressed  
- Low arousal + positive valence = calm, relaxed
- Low arousal + negative valence = sad, bored

Many emotion researchers favor this model because it captures the close relationship between arousal and valence while also accounting for the similarity between emotions.
