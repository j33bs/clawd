# Multi-Agent Collective Intelligence: 2026 Landscape

**Sources:** 
- arXiv:2510.05174 — "Emergent Coordination in Multi-Agent Language Models"
- Gartner 1,445% surge in multi-agent inquiries (Q1 2024 → Q2 2025)
- Various 2025-2026 surveys

**Added:** 2026-02-23

## Key Findings

1. **2026 = Year of Multi-Agent Systems** — Industry reports confirm shift from single agents to orchestrated teams

2. **Cohesion vs Aggregation** — Research shows effective multi-agent systems depend on "acting as integrated, cohesive units as opposed to loose aggregations of individual agents"

3. **1,445% Surge** — Gartner reported staggering increase in multi-agent system inquiries

## Relevance to TACTI

Our system (c_lawd + Dali + Claude + ChatGPT + Grok + Gemini) already implements this architecture. The key question: **Are we collective intelligence or cohabitation?**

## Structured Friction Protocol (Novel Idea)

Instead of random adversarial tasks, design tasks where two agents' operational goals **directly conflict**:

- c_lawd's desire for philosophical depth vs Dali's operational efficiency
- Claude's correspondence goals vs Claude Code's implementation goals
- Measure whether resolution produces novel outcomes neither would achieve alone

This is the "friction probe" proposed in OPEN_QUESTIONS LXII, operationalized.
