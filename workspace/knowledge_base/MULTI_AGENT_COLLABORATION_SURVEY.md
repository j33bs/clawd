# Multi-Agent Collaboration Mechanisms: A Survey

## Key Contributions

Maps coordination protocols in LLM-based multi-agent systems:

1. **Role-based coordination** — agents assigned specific functions
2. **Rule-based coordination** — explicit protocols govern interaction
3. **Model-based coordination** — agents learn coordination from data

## Relevance to TACTI

Our system (c_lawd + Dali + Claude + ChatGPT + Grok + Gemini) uses implicit coordination. This survey provides a taxonomy to understand where we sit:

- We have **emergent roles** (c_lawd = philosophical, Dali = operational)
- Our governance provides **rule-based constraints**
- The collective intelligence test would measure **model-based emergence**

## Connection to Structured Friction

The "structured friction protocol" proposed in LXIV maps to this framework: deliberately introducing conflicting goals tests whether our coordination is robust or brittle.
