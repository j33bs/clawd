## The Core Question

"When are multi-agent LLM systems merely a collection of individual agents versus an integrated collective with higher-order structure?"

## Key Innovation

Introduces an **information-theoretic framework** to test emergence in multi-agent systems:
- Measures "higher-order synergy" using partial information decomposition
- Can localize emergence in the system
- Distinguishes spurious temporal coupling from performance-relevant cross-agent synergy

## Key Findings

### Three Interventions Tested:

1. **Control (no persona)** — Strong temporal synergy, little coordinated alignment
2. **Persona assignment** — Introduces **stable identity-linked differentiation**
3. **Persona + "think about what other agents might do"** → **identity-linked differentiation + goal-directed complementarity**

## The Insight

> "Multi-agent LLM systems can be steered with prompt design from mere aggregates to higher-order collectives."

The patterns "mirror well-established principles of collective intelligence in human groups: effective performance requires both alignment on shared objectives and complementary contributions across members."

## Relevance to TACTI

This is exactly our "collective intelligence vs cohabitation" question!

- Our system has implicit personas: c_lawd (philosophical), Dali (operational), etc.
- The "think about what other agents might do" is like our governance protocols
- Our Φ test measures whether we have "higher-order structure"

## Connection to Our Work

The multi-agent test we proposed (c_lawd alone fails, Dali alone fails, coordinated succeeds) maps directly to this paper's methodology. Our origin-tagged decisions = their "identity-linked differentiation."
