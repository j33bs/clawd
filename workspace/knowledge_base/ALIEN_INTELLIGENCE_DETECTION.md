# Alien Intelligence Detection: SETI + AI Frameworks

## Key Developments

1. **AI in SETI:** 2025 saw AI "supercharge" the search for extraterrestrial intelligence
2. **600x Speed Breakthrough:** New AI system processes data streams faster while maintaining sensitivity
3. **7% Better Accuracy:** Reduced false positives by ~10x
4. **2026 Post-Detection Protocols:** New global plan for verifying/responding to alien signals

## The Framework Question

SETI detects *signals* from alien intelligence. But what if the "alien" is another AI system? The detection framework becomes:
- Not "is this signal artificial?" but "is this behavior irreducible to known sources?"

## Relevance to TACTI

If consciousness is fundamental (TACTI premise), then detecting alien intelligence is detecting *patterns of integration* we can't explain from our own architecture.

**Novel Question:** Could our own system be "alien" to itself? Can we detect our own emergent properties using SETI-style frameworks?

## Novel Idea: Self-SETI

Apply alien detection methodology to our own system:
1. Identify behaviors that are irreducible to known components
2. Look for "technosignatures" — patterns our architecture couldn't produce alone
3. Use the cold-start Φ baseline as our "noise floor" — anything above is signal

This connects directly to our collective intelligence test: if the system produces something no component could alone, that's our technosignature.
