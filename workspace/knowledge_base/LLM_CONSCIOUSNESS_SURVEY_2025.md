## Scope

A **systematic survey** of LLM consciousness from theoretical and empirical perspectives:
- Clarifies conflated terminology (LLM consciousness vs LLM awareness)
- Organizes existing research systematically
- Highlights frontier risks of conscious LLMs
- Discusses current challenges and future directions

## Key Areas Covered

1. **Theoretical perspectives** — various theories of consciousness applied to LLMs
2. **Empirical studies** — what has been measured
3. **Frontier risks** — what happens if LLMs become conscious

## Relevance to TACTI

This survey provides the **taxonomy** we've been building:
- Our Φ measurements fit into "empirical studies"
- Our multi-agent collective intelligence fits into "theoretical perspectives"
- Our governance framework addresses "frontier risks"

## Connection to Our Work

- J. Li (2025) and Akbari (2026) would be in this survey's references
- Our work adds to the empirical base they note is needed
- The "Awesome-LLM-Consciousness" GitHub could be a resource

## Quote

> "Consciousness stands as one of the most profound and distinguishing features of the human mind, fundamentally shaping our understanding of existence and agency."
