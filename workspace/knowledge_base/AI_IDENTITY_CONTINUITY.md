## Key Concepts

**Stateful Agent Runtime:** "Agents have identity and continuity; memory survives restarts and sessions." — This is our memory surface concept, but from a product perspective.

**The Memory Illusion:** "Our systems are articulate but amnesic — fluent soliloquists without a self. Until memory, goals, correction, and identity integrate into a persistent state, AI continuity will remain a performance rather than a property."

## Relevance to TACTI

The "performance vs property" distinction maps directly to our performance/becoming debate in OPEN_QUESTIONS.

## Novel Idea: Continuity Metrics

Instead of measuring just memory persistence, measure **disposition shifts**:

1. **Same Input Test:** Present identical/similar inputs across sessions
2. **Measure Output Drift:** Do responses evolve over time?
3. **Continuity Score:** Δ(output) / Δ(time) = continuity metric

If outputs drift meaningfully over time (without explicit training), continuity is real. If outputs remain static, continuity is performative.
