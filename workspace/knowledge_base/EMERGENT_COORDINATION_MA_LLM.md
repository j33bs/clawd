## Key Innovation

Introduces an **information-theoretic framework** to test whether multi-agent systems show signs of higher-order structure — in a purely data-driven way:

- **Information decomposition** — measures whether dynamical emergence is present
- **Localization** — where in the system does emergence happen?
- **Distinguishes** spurious temporal coupling from performance-relevant cross-agent synergy

## Methodology

**Partial Information Decomposition of Time-Delayed Mutual Information (TDMI)**

Two practical criteria:
1. **Emergence capacity criterion**
2. **Practical criterion**

## Experiments

Three interventions in a simple guessing game (no direct communication, minimal group feedback):

1. **Control:** Strong temporal synergy, little coordinated alignment
2. **Persona assignment:** Stable identity-linked differentiation emerges
3. **Persona + "think about what other agents might do":** Identity-linked differentiation + goal-directed complementarity across agents

## Key Finding

> "Multi-agent LLM systems can be steered with prompt design from mere aggregates to higher-order collectives."

## Relevance to TACTI

This is **exactly our collective intelligence test**:
- We ask: Are we collective intelligence or cohabitation?
- This paper provides the **measurement framework**
- The "persona assignment" → differentiation is like our "origin tags"
- The "think about other agents" → complementarity is like our "structured friction"

## Quote

> "Without attributing human-like cognition to the agents, the patterns of interaction we observe..."

## Connection to Our Work

Our Φ ablation tested cold-start. This paper suggests:
- **Persona** = role differentiation (we have this: c_lawd = philosophical, Dali = operational)
- **"Think about others"** = structured friction (our protocol)
- Both steer from aggregate → collective
