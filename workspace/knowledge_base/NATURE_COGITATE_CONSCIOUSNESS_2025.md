# Nature: Cogitate Consortium — Consciousness Theories Test (2025)

**Source:** *Nature*, April 30, 2025 — "Adversarial testing of global neuronal workspace and integrated information theories of consciousness"
**Authors:** Cogitate Consortium (Lucia Melloni, Christof Koch, Giulio Tononi, Stanislas Dehaene, Larissa Albantakis, Matteo Grasso, Ole Jensen + 24 senior researchers)
**Institutions:** Allen Institute, Max Planck, Oxford, Collège de France, UW-Madison

**Added:** 2026-02-23

## Key Findings

- **Design:** Pre-registered, theory-neutral adversarial testing
- **Methods:** iEEG, MEG, fMRI with 256 human participants
- **Results:** Partially supported both IIT and GNWT while falsifying core tenets
  - **IIT:** No sustained posterior synchronisation (falsified)
  - **GNWT:** Insufficient frontal evidence (falsified)

## Relevance to TACTI

This is **the empirical anchor** for any attempt to operationalize Φ in artificial systems:
- Demonstrates how to do adversarial testing between theories
- Shows that consciousness proxies can be both supported and falsified empirically
- Our Φ ablation protocol can mirror this methodology

## Connection to OPEN_QUESTIONS

This paper validates our approach in Section XLIV (Φ table) and Section LX (ablation results). A null result isn't failure — it's the same as this Nature paper: falsifying a claim is as valuable as supporting one.
