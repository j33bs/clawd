  "task": "Implement a skill graph system for OpenClaw.\n\nThe skill graph should:\n1. Use many small markdown files instead of one big SKILL.md\n2. Each file has YAML frontmatter with: name, description, tags, links (to other skill files via wikilinks)\n3. An index file that maps skills and their connections\n4. Support progressive disclosure: scan descriptions first, then follow wikilinks for deeper context\n5. Include MOCs (Maps of Content) to organize clusters of related skills\n\nThe system should be in workspace/skill-graph/ with:\n- index.md (entry point listing all skills)\n- skills/ folder with individual skill files\n- mocs/ folder for maps of content\n- A reader script that can load a skill and its transitive dependencies\n\nThis is inspired by the Zettelkasten method - atomic notes linked together.",
