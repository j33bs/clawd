  "task": "Design and implement Source UI - a comprehensive, beautiful system management dashboard for OpenClaw.\n\n## Vision\nSource UI should be a testament to collaborative engineering - a beautiful, functional control center that launches with the gateway and provides full agent orchestration.\n\n## Architecture Requirements\n1. **Self-hosting web app** that runs as part of OpenClaw system\n2. **Service-based architecture**: Separate components for each domain\n3. **Real-time updates** via WebSocket connections to gateway\n4. **Modular design** - easy to add new features\n5. **Production-ready** - error handling, logging, graceful degradation\n\n## Core Features\n\n### 1. Task Management\n- Kanban-style board (Backlog \u2192 In Progress \u2192 Review \u2192 Done)\n- Drag-and-drop task reordering\n- Priority levels with visual indicators\n- Task details panel with full context\n- Create/edit/delete tasks\n- Task templates for common operations\n- Filter by status, priority, assignee\n\n### 2. Agent Orchestration\n- Visual agent cards with real-time status\n- Resource usage per agent (CPU, memory, tokens)\n- Start/stop/pause/resume controls\n- Agent configuration panel\n- Multi-agent workflow visualization\n- Agent activity timeline\n\n### 3. Schedule Management\n- Interactive calendar (month/week/day views)\n- Cron expression builder with human-readable descriptions\n- Drag-to-reschedule events\n- Upcoming jobs timeline\n- Job history with success/failure rates\n- Quick-add scheduled tasks\n\n### 4. System Health Dashboard\n- Real-time metrics (CPU, memory, disk, GPU)\n- Component status grid (Gateway, VLLM, Telegram, Memory)\n- Health history graphs\n- Alert thresholds with notifications\n- Quick actions (restart, clear cache, etc.)\n\n### 5. Activity & Notifications\n- Real-time activity feed\n- Notification center with read/unread\n- Filter by type (info, success, warning, error)\n- Desktop notifications support\n\n### 6. Command Palette\n- Cmd+K to open\n- Fuzzy search for commands\n- Recent commands\n- Keyboard shortcuts throughout\n\n## UI/UX Requirements\n- Dark theme as default (with light toggle)\n- Responsive design (desktop-first, works on tablet)\n- Smooth animations (60fps)\n- Skeleton loaders for async content\n- Toast notifications\n- Modal system\n- Consistent design language\n\n## Technical Stack\n- Single-page app with vanilla JS or lightweight framework\n- CSS custom properties for theming\n- LocalStorage for preferences\n- WebSocket for real-time updates (or polling fallback)\n- REST API integration with OpenClaw gateway\n\n## File Structure\n\n\n## Integration\n- Should be servable from gateway (add route or static file)\n- Or run on separate port with proxy\n- Auto-start via systemd service or gateway hook\n\nThis should be BEAUTIFUL, functional, and a true testament to what's possible when humans and agents work together.
