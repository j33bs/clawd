# OpenClaw Memory Index (Workspace)

This file is a stable, cross-platform index. Do not replace with symlinks.

## Node Memory
- Dali (System-1): `nodes/dali/memory/`
- C_Lawd (System-2): `nodes/c_lawd/memory/` (if present)

## Notes
- Daily memory entries live under the relevant node directory.
- `workspace/memory/` is reserved for legacy/back-compat and should not be a symlink.
