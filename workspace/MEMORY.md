# MEMORY.md - Long-term Memory

This is the curated, long-term memory that persists across sessions. This file contains distilled insights, important decisions, and key information worth remembering long-term.

## System Configuration & Setup

- **Date Established**: 2026-02-02
- **System**: OpenClaw with Qwen portal integration
- **Connected Channels**: Telegram (@r3spond3rbot)
- **Issue Fixed**: Missing memory directory structure causing ENOENT errors

## Key Learnings

- Fresh installations need proper initialization of memory subsystem
- The memory directory (C:\Users\heath\.openclaw\workspace\memory) must exist for daily logs
- Daily memory files follow YYYY-MM-DD.md naming convention
- MEMORY.md serves as long-term curated memory (only loaded in main session)

## Important Decisions

- [2026-02-02] Created proper memory directory structure to resolve routing errors
- [2026-02-02] Initialized both daily memory file and long-term MEMORY.md
- [2026-02-04] Completed ITC Pipeline with full governance framework including regression harness, change admission gate, and incident protocols

## Preferences & Notes

- System is operational with Telegram integration working properly
- Tool routing now resolved after creating missing directories
