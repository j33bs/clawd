# Time Management Tips - Contemporary Best Practices

## Categories

### 1. Deep Work & Focus
- "Block 90 minutes for deep work. Your brain needs time to hit flow state."
- "Single-tasking beats multitasking. Close other tabs. One project at a time."
- "Do your most important task first. Eat the frog before anything else."
- "Schedule 'deep work' blocks. Treat them like meetings you can't miss."

### 2. Energy Management
- "Manage energy, not just time. Work when you're峰值, rest when you're not."
- "Take a 10-minute walk between focused sessions. Movement resets your brain."
- "Schedule breaks proactively. Your brain can't sustain focus for hours."
- "Protect your morning peak hours. Save meetings for afternoon."

### 3. Planning & Prioritization
- "Identify your MIT (Most Important 3 Tasks) each morning. Everything else is optional."
- "The 2-minute rule: If it takes <2 minutes, do it now."
- "Review tomorrow's tasks tonight. Your brain processes while you sleep."
- "Weekly review: What worked? What didn't? Adjust accordingly."

### 4. Systems & Habits
- "Time block your calendar. If it's not scheduled, it doesn't exist."
- "Batch similar tasks: emails, calls, admin. Context switching costs 20+ mins."
- "Create routines. Habits use less willpower than decisions."
- "Default to no. Protect your time like your money."

### 5. Modern Productivity
- "No-meeting Fridays. Create space for execution."
- "Use the 4D framework: Delete, Delegate, Defer, Do."
- "Build buffer time between meetings. You need transition time."
- "Don't check email first thing. It's reactive, not productive."

### 6. Self-Compassion
- "Not everything needs your attention. Let some things fail."
- "Productivity isn't about doing more. It's about doing what matters."
- "Rest is productive. Your brain needs downtime to consolidate."
- "Say no without guilt. Your time is your most valuable resource."
