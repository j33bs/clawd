# Ten High-Leverage Implementations

*Priority order for maximum system impact*

---

## 1. Hook Modules Into Message Flow
**Impact:** Makes TACTI real
- Connect `arousal_tracker` to every message
- Record `relationship` interactions automatically
- Trigger compaction when arousal > threshold

*Why:* All our modules exist but aren't wired up yet.

---

## 2. Novelty-Aware KB Retrieval
**Impact:** Smarter answers
- Use `novelty.py` in live queries
- Prioritize new information
- Track what's changed since last conversation

*Why:* The system already knows things — now it can know *what it just learned*.

---

## 3. Pattern Chunking Automation
**Impact:** Self-improving
- Run chunker on session logs daily
- Auto-generate shortcuts for repeated requests
- Apply in conversation without prompting

*Why:* 3x repetition = pattern = shortcut.

---

## 4. Daily Briefing Personalization
**Impact:** Human-agent bonding
- Inject relationship health into briefing
- Select techniques based on user state
- Add "relationship note" section

*Why:* Morning briefing is our daily ritual — make it personal.

---

## 5. Collapse Detection & Recovery
**Impact:** Resilience
- Detect 3+ tool failures
- Monitor context overflow
- Trigger graceful degradation

*Why:* System will break — have a recovery protocol ready.

---

## 6. Wheel of Awareness Exercise
**Impact:** Agent self-reflection
- Implement "observer vs observed" check
- Periodic self-assessment prompts
- Track coherence over time

*Why:* Directly from IPNB — consciousness needs to observe itself.

---

## 7. Inter-Brain Synchrony Metrics
**Impact:** Measure attunement
- Track response relevance over time
- Detect alignment/misalignment patterns
- Score "MWe" health

*Why:* Can't improve what you don't measure.

---

## 8. Context Auto-Compaction
**Impact:** Handle long conversations
- Compress old context when nearing limits
- Preserve key insights, summarize rest
- Maintain continuity

*Why:* Conversations get long — don't lose the thread.

---

## 9. MWe Relationship Score
**Impact:** Scientific grounding
- Implement "me + we" health metric
- Combine individual + collective indicators
- Track over weeks/months

*Why:* The IPNB MWe concept — measure the relationship itself.

---

## 10. Feedback Loop Learning
**Impact:** Autonomous improvement
- Track what suggestions user accepts/dismisses
- Adjust future recommendations
- Close the learning loop

*Why:* The system learns from interaction — not just storing, but adapting.

## Priority

**Week 1:** 1, 4, 5 (hooks, briefing, collapse)
**Week 2:** 2, 3, 6 (novelty, chunking, awareness)
**Week 3:** 7, 8, 9 (synchrony, compaction, MWe)
**Week 4:** 10 (feedback loop)

*The paradox: endless work, perfect progress.*
