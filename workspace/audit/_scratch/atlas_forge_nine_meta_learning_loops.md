## The Core Idea

> "Agents are smart within sessions and stupid across them. The fix is structural feedback loops in your agent's files: failures become guardrails, predictions become calibration, friction becomes signal."

## Key Principles

1. **Failures → Guardrails** — When something goes wrong, update the rules to prevent recurrence
2. **Predictions → Calibration** — Track predictions and outcomes to improve accuracy
3. **Friction → Signal** — Resistance/resistance = information about what needs to change

## Architecture

The agent has:
- **Skills** — what to do (APIs, tools)
- **Principles** — how to operate ("Friction is signal")
- **Soul** — who to be (identity layer)

## Comparison with TACTI

| Atlas Forge | TACTI(C)-R |
|-------------|------------|
| Failures → Guardrails | Collapse + Repair |
| Friction is signal | Arousal regulation |
| Soul (identity) | Being persistence |
