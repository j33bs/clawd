## Abstract

AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures.

Here we propose an **adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation** - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates:
- Transfer of authority
- Responsibility and accountability
- Clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries
- Clarity of intent
- Mechanisms for establishing trust between parties

The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging **agentic web**.

## Key Concepts

- **Intelligent Delegation:** Not just task handoff, but scoped authority + responsibility + accountability + monitoring
- **Delegation Capability Tokens (DCTs):** Attenuated authorization to prevent systemic breaches and "confused deputy problem" — principle of least privilege
- **Role boundaries:** Clear delineation of what each agent can/cannot do
- **Trust mechanisms:** That hold up when environments change or agents fail

## TACTI(C)-R Relevance

This framework aligns with TACTI's relational framing:
- Authority transfer = TACTI's agency/repair principles
- Trust mechanisms = TACTI's arousal/regulation
- Accountability = TACTI's relational binding

The "agentic web" vision parallels the multi-agent TACTI research directions.
