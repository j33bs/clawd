# Quarantine: Dirty Working Tree (2026-02-12)

- Dirty worktree path: `/Users/heathyeager/clawd`
- Dirty branch: `redact/audit-evidence-20260212`
- Quarantine reason: preserve ongoing unrelated audit/redaction changes; avoid cross-contamination while implementing PR body lint governance in an isolated worktree.
- Handling decision: no stash, no clean, no stage, no modify operations performed on the dirty tree.
