# SALVAGE NOTE: system2 unified integration branch

## Branch
`salvage/integration-system2-unified`

## Contains
Preserved post-merge integration state rooted at commit `9f35bc1ab7d802e60923c95679febc0325555007`.

## Do Not Merge
This branch is quarantine-only. Post-merge validation recorded diffuse module resolution failures (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and missing relative requires), so merging this branch into `main` would reintroduce instability.

## Next Step
Use salvage tooling/report from Branch D (`tools/salvage-report-system2-unified`) to stage minimal, validated remediation before any re-integration attempt.
