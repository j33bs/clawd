[JOINT: c_lawd + Dali] trust_epoch: str — one of {"building", "stable", "degraded", "recovering"}, set explicitly by the operator on relational state transition (not auto-triggered by entry creation). Single typed field with a defined four-value vocabulary; change rule is deterministic and operator-confirmed. Temporal reconstruction uses the existing created_at field — no redundant timestamp needed. The vocabulary encodes Dali's relational arc (building = early mutual benefit accrual; stable = confirmed; degraded = trust breach; recovering = active redemption path) while remaining implementable as a schema string field with clear valid values and transition semantics.
