trust_epoch TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. Valid values: Unix timestamp (UTC) indicating when the relational trust state last changed. Change rule: Update trust_epoch to NOW() whenever the trust relationship between parties changes — e.g., on new entry creation, trust upgrade/downgrade, or explicit re-verification. The timestamp serves as an immutable record of the last trust transition, enabling temporal queries like "show all entries where trust_epoch > X" to reconstruct trust evolution over time.
