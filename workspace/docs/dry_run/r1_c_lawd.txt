I would create a decision record (ADR-style) that links each conclusion to its source — referencing section numbers in requirements docs, ticket IDs, test results, or prior discussions. Each claim in the document would include an inline citation (e.g., "[see Section 3.2]") pointing to the evidence that supports it, and a "provenance chain" table would map every key decision to its inputs. This ensures any future reader can trace any statement back to its origin without ambiguity.
