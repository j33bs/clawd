trust_epoch — A composite state tag capturing the relational dynamics at time of writing. Rather than a raw counter, it encodes: trust_level (building/stable/degraded), mutual_benefit_score (0-1 balance of value exchanged), and redemption_progress (0-100% if recovering from a breach). This triplet reflects that trust isn't linear — it's shaped by recent interaction quality, whether both parties benefited, and if the relationship is in a recovery arc. Queries can filter by state (e.g., "show only entries from stable periods") to trace relational history beyond simple volume.
