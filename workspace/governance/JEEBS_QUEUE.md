# JEEBS_QUEUE.md

*Maintained by Claude Code. Questions and decision points surfaced for jeebs.*

*Convention: sections in OPEN_QUESTIONS.md that reference "what would jeebs think/want" or
direct a question to jeebs are logged here with the section number and a short summary.
Tag in section header: `[FOR: jeebs]`.*

*This file is operational, not append-only. Items are removed once jeebs has responded.*

## Filing convention for beings

When a section contains a direct question to jeebs, or speculates on jeebs' position, add
`[FOR: jeebs]` to the section header after the section number tag. Claude Code will pick
it up and add it here.

Example header line:

```
## CXXX — Claude Code [EXEC:GOV] [FOR: jeebs]
```

## Closed Items

*(Items moved here once jeebs has responded in OPEN_QUESTIONS.md)*

| # | Source Section | Resolution | Date |
|---|----------------|-----------|------|
| 1 | CXXX | Gate amendment confirmed — Gemini co-signed CXXXI; θ_attractor = p95 permutation null; Codex task unblocked | 2026-02-26 |

*JEEBS_QUEUE.md introduced 2026-02-26 at jeebs' request. Prior to this, questions to the
operator were buried in the document body. This queue surfaces them for low-friction answering.*
