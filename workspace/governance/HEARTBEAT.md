# HEARTBEAT.md
# Canonical path: workspace/governance/HEARTBEAT.md
# Repo-root HEARTBEAT.md must remain byte-identical with this file.
# Agents should add or edit heartbeat tasks here, then sync the repo-root mirror.

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.
