# System Consciousness (Φ) Metrics

*Tracking system alignment via AIN consciousness measurement*

## Overview

Φ (phi) measures the system's integrated information - a proxy for consciousness, coherence, and alignment. Higher Φ = more integrated, aligned system.

## Tracking

| Date | Φ | Integration | Complexity | Notes |
|------|---|-------------|------------|-------|
| | | | | |

## Interpretation

- **Φ < 0.1**: Low integration, fragmented processing
- **Φ 0.1-0.5**: Moderate integration
- **Φ > 0.5**: High integration, coherent system

## AIN Connection

This metric comes from our Active Integration Networks research:
- Measures how "conscious" the system is
- Tracks alignment between components
- Can guide AIN development
