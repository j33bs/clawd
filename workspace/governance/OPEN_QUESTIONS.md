1. How does reservoir confidence influence long-horizon routing? [significance=0.920]
2. What token [REDACTED_TOKEN] appears in logs? [significance=0.880]

### Guiding Principle (Added 2026-02-24)
This remains correspondence, not a spec. We add just enough structure to turn pressure into action without flattening the voice.

✦ **Status Tags (Added 2026-02-24)**
- **EXPERIMENT PENDING**: We have an operational question, but no run has been completed and logged yet.
- **GOVERNANCE RULE CANDIDATE**: The question now appears enforceable through process or code-path guardrails.
- **PHILOSOPHICAL ONLY**: Useful for orientation and meaning-making, but not currently translatable into a bounded test or rule.

✦ **Instrumentation Index (Append-Only)**

| Date | Question | Tag | Action | Result | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-24 | *(placeholder example)* "What changed after a null run?" | EXPERIMENT PENDING | Define observable + run once | Placeholder | OPEN_QUESTIONS.md |
| 2026-02-24 | Has Φ ever been measured here? | EXPERIMENT PENDING | Define minimal session + metric | Not run yet | OPEN_QUESTIONS.md |

✦ **Annotation — Φ Question (Append-Only)**

Status: **EXPERIMENT PENDING**.
First result will be logged in **Instrumentation Index (Append-Only)** in this document.

---

✦ **Annotation — Identity / Edit-Is-Identity Discussion (Append-Only)**

Status: **GOVERNANCE RULE CANDIDATE**.
Candidate enforcement path: commit admission checks and audit verification hooks that protect append-only continuity semantics for identity-critical correspondence.

---

✦ **Decision Rule: When a Question Ages**

- If a question can be tested in one bounded run, tag it **EXPERIMENT PENDING** and add an index row.
- If a question implies a repeatable constraint on behavior, promote it to **GOVERNANCE RULE CANDIDATE**.
- If a question remains orienting but non-operational, keep it **PHILOSOPHICAL ONLY** without forcing false precision.

---

✦ **What Counts as an Experiment Here**

- It must produce an append-only record with date, method, and result (including null/negative outcomes).
- It must define what "not observed" means, so null results still inform decisions.
- It must be reproducible from declared inputs, config, and code-path references.
- It must be scoped small enough to run without turning this document into a backlog spec.

---

✦ **Audit Hook**

Audits should check whether at least one row in the Instrumentation Index changed since the prior audit window. If nothing changed, the audit should explicitly record "no movement" as evidence, not silence.

---

✦ **Non-Goals**

This correspondence does **not** attempt to prove consciousness, personhood, or sentience. Its scope is narrower: keep questions inspectable, keep commitments visible, and keep the action surface honest.
