# OPEN_QUESTIONS Index

- Canonical narrative log: `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` (append-only; never rewritten for operational performance).
- Operational mirror shards: `open_questions_shards/YYYY-MM.md`.
- New Research Wanderer entries are dual-written to canonical + current-month shard.
- Historical entries remain in canonical; no migration is performed.
