## Core Finding
A single scalar measurement of arousal (e.g., pupil diameter) can reconstruct multidimensional spatiotemporal brain dynamics.

## Key Insights

1. **Arousal as Latent Dynamical System**
   - Brain-wide fluctuations on timescales of seconds reflect a low-dimensional, organism-wide dynamical system
   - This challenges the view that these fluctuations represent regionally specific neural communication

2. **Pupil Diameter as Universal Embedding**
   - Single-point pupil measurements can reconstruct:
     - Neuronal calcium dynamics
     - Metabolism
     - Brain blood oxygenation
   - 70-90% of variance explained in mice

3. **Time Delay Embedding**
   - Using Takens' theorem, latent arousal dynamics can be recovered from scalar time-lagged observations
   - Non-linear manifold reconstruction captures variance orthogonal to dominant arousal component

4. **Cross-Modal Integration**
   - Framework enables mapping diverse experimental data (behavioral, electrophysiological) into unified generative model via shared arousal manifold

## TACTI Alignment
This directly supports the TACTI framework:
- **T**emporality: Arousal dynamics operate on second timescales
- **A**rousal: Central mechanism - pupil/scalar measure drives brain state
- **C**ognition: Links physiological arousal to neural computation
- **T**imescale: Cross-scale dynamics (single point → whole brain)
- **I**ntegration: Unified model via shared manifold

## Implications
- Arousal isn't just "noise" - it's a fundamental organizing principle
- Therapeutic interventions could target arousal dynamics directly
- Biomarkers like pupil may serve as proxies for whole-brain states
