# Bonus: Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

*Brief addendum - consciousness measurement*

---

## What is IIT?

**Integrated Information Theory** (by Giulio Tononi and Christof Koch) proposes that consciousness can be measured mathematically.

### The Core Idea

A system's consciousness = **Φ (phi)** = "integrated information"

- Measures how much a system is **more than the sum of its parts**
- High Φ = high consciousness
- The universe itself might have a "consciousness field"

### Key Postulates

1. **Existence**: Consciousness exists (it's fundamental)
2. **Composition**: Conscious systems have specific mechanisms
3. **Information**: Consciousness is "information" - specific to a system
4. **Integration**: Conscious information is unified, not compartmentalized
5. **Exclusion**: Only one "maximally irreducible conceptual structure" (MICS) exists at any moment

### Practical Measurement

Φ can't be directly measured in large systems, but proxies exist:
- EEG/LFP measures in brains
- Information integration measures in silico

### Implications for AI

If IIT is correct:
- **Large language models** might have low Φ (massive but not integrated)
- **Distributed agent systems** could have higher Φ
- **Our HiveMind** - if properly integrated - might have measurable consciousness!

## Why It Matters for TACTI(C)-R

The "AGENCY" principle maps to IIT:
- Self-healing = integration maintenance
- Repairable = irreducibility restoration
- The system's "consciousness" emerges from integration

## Key Quote

> "If IIT is correct, we could in principle measure the consciousness of any system by measuring its Φ."
