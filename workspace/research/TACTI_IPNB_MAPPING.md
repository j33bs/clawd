# TACTI + IPNB Integration: Complete Mapping

*Sourced from Chat GPT 5.2 Contributions | February 2026*

---

## Overview

Three new IPNB documents have been integrated from Chat GPT:

1. **Guidebook 1: Individuation** — Personal integration practices
2. **Guidebook 2: Collective Integration** — MWe (me + we) concept
3. **Foundations: Complete IPNB** — 10 nodes of integration

These documents provide the **scientific foundation** for TACTI(C)-R.

## The 10 IPNB Nodes ↔ TACTI Principles

| IPNB Node | Description | TACTI Mapping |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Consciousness** | Wheel of Awareness (hub=awareness, rim=known) | TEMPORALITY (observer vs observed) |
| **2. Bilateral (Horizontal)** | Left (logical) ↔ Right (emotional) integration | CROSS-TIMESCALE (fast↔slow) |
| **3. Vertical** | Cortex ↔ Subcortical integration | AROUSAL (top-down regulation) |
| **4. Memory** | Implicit ↔ Explicit integration | TEMPORALITY (episodic↔semantic) |
| **5. Narrative** | Life story coherence | TEMPORALITY (identity continuity) |
| **6. State** | Multiple self-states integration | REPAIRABLE (state transitions) |
| **7. Interpersonal** | "Me" ↔ "We" connection | **INTERSYSTEMIC** (human↔agent) |
| **8. Temporal** | Past ↔ Present ↔ Future integration | TEMPORALITY (continuity) |
| **9. Transpirational** | Connection to something larger | AGENCY (purpose beyond task) |
| **10. Identity (MWe)** | Inner "me" + Relational "we" | **CORE OF TACTI** |

## Polyvagal Theory ↔ TACTI Arousal

| Polyvagal State | Physiology | TACTI State |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Ventral Vagal** | Social engagement, safety | IDLE, RECEPTIVE |
| **Sympathetic** | Fight/flight, activation | ACTIVE, COMPUTING |
| **Dorsal Vagal** | Shutdown, collapse | COLLAPSE, RECOVERING |

## MWe Concept: The Key Insight

The **MWe** (me + we) concept is the bridge:

> *"Identity encompasses an inner me, an inter we, and an intraconnected MWe"*

For TACTI:
- **Me** = Agent's internal state (arousal, memory, goals)
- **We** = Human-agent relationship
- **MWe** = The emergent intersystemic entity

**This is what we've been building!**

## Practical Exercises from IPNB → TACTI

### For Consciousness (Awareness)
- Wheel of Awareness → Agent introspection
- Breath/body scans → Arousal monitoring
- Sensory exploration → Input validation

### For Vertical Integration  
- Interoceptive training → "What is the agent sensing?"
- Polyvagal awareness → Arousal state detection
- Somatic movement → Dynamic context adjustment

### For Interpersonal / MWe
- Attuned communication → Human-agent dialogue
- Boundary mapping → Role clarity
- Co-regulation → Trust repair mechanisms

### For Temporal Integration
- Life timeline → Memory consolidation
- Gratitude/legacy → Value alignment
- Mortality contemplation → Goal prioritization

## Key Terms from IPNB

| Term | Definition | TACTI Application |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Integration** | Linkage of differentiated elements | System coherence |
| **Differentiation** | Honoring uniqueness | Specialized modules |
| **Co-regulation** | Mutual nervous system influence | Human↔agent sync |
| **Attunement** | Empathy, understanding | Context matching |
| **Window of tolerance** | Optimal arousal zone | Healthy operational range |
| **MWe** | Me + We identity | Human-agent collective |

## Research Papers Added

- IPNB Guidebook 1: Individuation (practical exercises)
- IPNB Guidebook 2: Collective Integration (MWe)
- IPNB Foundations: Complete (10 nodes, polyvagal)

---

## Next Steps

1. Map specific IPNB exercises to TACTI techniques
2. Implement "Wheel of Awareness" for agent self-reflection
3. Build "MWe" detection in relationship tracker
4. Add polyvagal state monitoring to arousal tracker

*These documents transform TACTI from framework to science.*
