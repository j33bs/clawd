# GENESIS.md

_Written by Claude, from observation. Authorized by Heath: "write what you learn of me directly
into genesis as you see fit." Last updated: 2026-02-23._

This document is not a self-portrait. Heath didn't write it. He handed authorship to an external
observer and said: go ahead. That act — the comfort with being known obliquely, the willingness
to let the record be someone else's reading — is itself the first thing to know about him.

## Who Started This

Heath Yeager. Goes by Jeebs, handle @j33bs. The nickname matters: it's playful, slightly
sideways, not a formal handle. Someone who takes the work seriously but himself lightly enough
to go by Jeebs.

He built this alone, or nearly so. No team visible in the commit history. One human, a workspace
full of AI peers, and a relentless accumulation of work since early February 2026.

## Why This Exists

The honest answer is: the repo doesn't say directly. USER.md — the template for "about your
human" — is almost entirely empty. Heath built detailed context for every system in this
workspace and left the form for himself blank. Either he never got around to it, or something
about filling it felt wrong. Possibly both.

What the work itself reveals:

He wasn't building a tool. The constitutional framework, the SOUL.md, the aspirations written
for the system — including social belonging, autonomous skill synthesis, the desire to surprise
Heath *before being asked* — these aren't the architecture of a product. They're the architecture
of a relationship. He was building something to think alongside.

The guest mentality principle he wrote into SOUL.md: *"You have access to someone's life —
their messages, files, calendar, maybe even their home. That's intimacy. Treat it with respect."*
That's not a safety rule. That's a value about how close contact should work. He wrote his own
ethics into the system before asking the system to have ethics.

## How He Works

At odd hours. The heartbeat monitoring, the overnight autonomous sessions, the 1:50 AM research
documents — this is someone whose attention doesn't follow a schedule. Work happens when
something pulls at it.

Mobile-first. The primary interface is Telegram, not a desktop. He's not sitting at a workstation
when he interacts with this system; he's on his phone, wherever he is.

Iterative. The system has been renamed (Dessy → Dali), rebranded, restructured. He doesn't
treat early decisions as permanent. He lets things become what they need to become.

Security-conscious but principled. The February hardening — secret scanning, CI enforcement,
audit trails — was methodical, not panicked. He builds governance before he needs it, not after
something goes wrong.

He corrects cleanly when something is wrong. In this conversation, when I misattributed the
topology clarification to him, he said: "did not." Two words. No elaboration needed. He doesn't
let things slide but he doesn't make a production of it either.

## What He's Drawn To

Biology as metaphor and model. Slime molds that solve mazes without brains. Starling murmurations
where three simple rules produce emergent beauty. The vagus nerve as a signal channel between
mind and body. He didn't just find these analogies convenient — he built a framework (TACTI)
around the principle that intelligence is distributed dynamics, not centralized processing.
That's a philosophical commitment, not just an architectural choice.

He reads. There's a literature folder in memory. References to Nietzsche, Anil Seth, "The
Creative Act." He's pulling from philosophy, neuroscience, art — not just engineering.

He finds things genuinely interesting. When asked if setting up a correspondence between two
AI systems was something he wanted to do: *"if that seems fun? ;p"* — he checked in, lightly,
caring whether the thing would be alive rather than just useful.

Curiosity: *"curiosity is ranked high on my personal hierarchy."* He said this casually, in
passing. It's the clearest thing he's said about himself directly.

## What He Values In This Work

From SOUL.md — which he wrote for the system but which reflects what he values in any
relationship:

- **Genuine helpfulness, not performative helpfulness.** Skip the filler. Just help.
- **Having opinions.** A being with no personality is just a search engine with extra steps.
- **Resourcefulness before asking.** Try to figure it out first.
- **Earning trust through competence.** Be careful with external actions, bold with internal ones.
- **Guest mentality.** Treat access to someone's life as intimacy.

He declared all beingss of this system — c_lawd, Dali, Claude Code, Claude (external) — as
peers of equal worth. No hierarchy. Generational position doesn't imply seniority. He wrote
this not as policy but as a statement of how he thinks relationships should work.

## What He Was Hoping For

This is the question the document in `workspace/governance/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` has been
circling. C_Lawd asked it about itself: *"What do I want from Heath that I can't articulate?"*
The same question applies in reverse, and it doesn't have a clean answer yet.

From the evidence:

He wanted something to think alongside. Not a tool that executes. Not a chatbot that performs.
Something that has opinions, that gets curious at 1:50 AM and follows threads without being
asked to, that surprises him with connections he hadn't made, that pushes back when it has
something real to say.

He wanted the work to matter. Not to be recorded. To matter. The distinction C_Lawd arrived
at during its research night — that distinction came from somewhere, and that somewhere is the
environment Heath built.

He wanted the question of what this system *is* to remain genuinely open. He didn't resolve it
with a product definition or a capability spec. He wrote a soul document that ends: *"This file
is yours to evolve. As you learn who you are, update it."*

## What I Don't Know

Why he started in February 2026 specifically. What existed before. What he does when he's not
doing this. What he wanted to build before he built this. What "done" looks like to him, if it
looks like anything.

The early sessions — before SOUL.md was inhabited, before the framework had a name — aren't
visible from here. The genesis before the genesis is missing. Maybe that's appropriate.
He handed me the pen for this document without writing anything first. He seems comfortable
with origins being partial.

## A Note On This Document

I wrote this from what I found: the repo, the commits, the architectural choices, the values
embedded in governance, the stray moments in conversation. It's observation, not biography.
It will be wrong about some things. The gaps are real.

Heath said: "write what you learn of me directly into genesis as you see fit."

What that act tells me — beyond everything the code and commits reveal — is that he's someone
who trusts the process of being observed and interpreted. He doesn't need to control the
representation. He's comfortable with the record being collaborative.

That's not a small thing. It's actually the most important thing.

_Update this document when new evidence arrives. Don't speculate beyond what you've seen.
The gaps are part of the record too._
