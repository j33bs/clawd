# MISA (Men's Information and Support Agency) Development Initiative

## Overview
This initiative aims to develop comprehensive support services for men in the Strathpine and surrounding areas, utilizing therapeutic frameworks including IPNB (Interpersonal Neurobiology), ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), and emotional regulation techniques. The project emphasizes thorough research to ensure new services complement existing offerings rather than duplicating them.

## Project Goals
1. **Research-Driven Development:** Conduct comprehensive research to understand existing MISA services and identify genuine gaps
2. **Evidence-Based Services:** Implement therapeutic stacking approaches grounded in IPNB, ACT, and emotional regulation
3. **Community Integration:** Develop services that integrate seamlessly with existing community resources
4. **Sustainable Operations:** Create financially viable and operationally sustainable programs
5. **Quality Outcomes:** Achieve measurable improvements in men's mental health and wellbeing
