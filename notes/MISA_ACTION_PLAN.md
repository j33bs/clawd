# MISA Development Action Plan

## Executive Summary
This action plan outlines the systematic approach to developing MISA (Men's Information and Support Agency) services that complement existing offerings rather than duplicating them. The plan emphasizes thorough research to identify genuine service gaps before implementing recommendations.

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

- **Access Risk:** Inability to obtain necessary information from MISA
- **Engagement Risk:** Low participation from target population
- **Funding Risk:** Insufficient funding for sustainable operations
- **Quality Risk:** New staff not adequately trained in therapeutic approaches

### Mitigation Strategies
