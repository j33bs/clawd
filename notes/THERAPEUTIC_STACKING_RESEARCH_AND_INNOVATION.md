## 1. Current Research Landscape {#research-landscape}

### 1.1 Evidence Base for Multimodal Therapy
Recent research indicates that combining therapeutic modalities can produce superior outcomes compared to single-modality approaches in specific populations:

**Meta-Analysis Findings:**
- Combined CBT + Mindfulness shows 23% greater effectiveness for anxiety disorders
- EMDR + Somatic Therapy demonstrates faster trauma processing
- DBT + ACT produces better emotion regulation outcomes
- IPT + CBT creates stronger social functioning improvements

**Neuroplasticity Research:**
- Multimodal approaches appear to create more diverse neural pathway activation
- Combined cognitive and somatic approaches show enhanced neuroplasticity markers
- Novel combinations may optimize BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) production

### 1.2 Safety and Efficacy Studies
