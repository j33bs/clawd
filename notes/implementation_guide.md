## Practical Considerations

### Adapting to Individual Needs
- Modify duration of each block based on client's capacity
- Adjust intensity of exercises according to client's comfort level
- Respect cultural differences in therapeutic approaches
- Consider trauma history when introducing certain techniques

### Common Challenges and Solutions
1. **Resistance to Structure:** Some clients may feel constrained by time blocks; emphasize that structure provides safety and predictability while allowing flexibility within each block.

2. **Emotional Overwhelm:** Use grounding techniques and emotional regulation strategies when clients become dysregulated during sessions.

3. **Therapist Confusion About Integration:** Practice moving between modalities in supervision; focus on the common threads between approaches rather than seeing them as separate entities.

4. **Client Expectations Mismatch:** Clearly explain the integrative approach at the beginning; address any concerns about using multiple therapeutic orientations.

### Measuring Progress
- Regular check-ins about session satisfaction
- Tracking emotional regulation improvements
- Monitoring progress toward identified values
- Assessing changes in relationship patterns
- Evaluating overall well-being and integration

### Termination Preparation
- Gradual reduction of session frequency as appropriate
- Review of skills learned across all modalities
- Development of ongoing self-care plan
- Identification of resources for continued growth
- Processing of ending-related emotions using all therapeutic approaches
