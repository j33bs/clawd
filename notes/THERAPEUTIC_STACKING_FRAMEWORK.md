# Therapeutic Stacking Framework
## Integrative Modalities, Compounds, and Contextual Approaches

### Executive Summary
Therapeutic stacking represents a sophisticated approach to mental health intervention that combines multiple therapeutic modalities, complementary compounds (when appropriate), and contextual factors to create synergistic healing experiences. This framework integrates evidence-based practices with innovative approaches to optimize therapeutic outcomes.

## 1. Foundational Concepts

### 1.1 Definition of Therapeutic Stacking
Therapeutic stacking is the strategic combination of multiple therapeutic modalities, interventions, and contextual elements designed to create synergistic effects that exceed the sum of individual components. Unlike simple multimodal therapy, stacking emphasizes:
- Sequential optimization of interventions
- Synergistic interactions between modalities
- Personalized compound integration (where appropriate)
- Contextual amplification factors

### 1.2 Core Principles
- **Synergy**: The combined effect exceeds individual modalities
- **Sequencing**: Order of interventions matters for optimal outcomes
- **Personalization**: Tailored to individual neurochemistry, psychology, and context
- **Safety**: Risk-benefit analysis for all combinations
- **Adaptability**: Responsive to individual response patterns
