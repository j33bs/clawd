**Subject: MISA Daily Brief - Feb 3, 2026 - Research Plan Launched**

Dear Practice Manager,

**Today's Progress:**
- Initiated comprehensive research plan to understand MISA's existing services and avoid duplicating current offerings
- Created detailed MISA research plan document outlining methodology to ensure recommendations address genuine gaps
- Established daily brief template and weekly update framework for consistent communication

**Tomorrow's Priorities:**
- Follow up on obtaining MISA leadership contact information to conduct formal interviews
- Begin detailed demographic analysis of Strathpine area focusing on male population needs
- Continue mapping current men's support services in the region to identify service gaps

**Research Notes:**
- Need direct contact with MISA staff to understand current service scope and identify authentic gaps
- Early preliminary research suggests focus on emotional regulation and IPNB/ACT integration may address genuine unmet needs
- Our therapeutic stacking framework could provide unique value if current services lack this approach

**Questions/Decisions Needed:**
- Could you provide contact information for MISA leadership or facilitate an introductory meeting?
- Are there any specific areas of concern regarding current service duplication that I should prioritize in my research?

Best regards,  
MISA Development Team
