- **What to call them:** jeebs (from @j33bs — lowercase, strongly preferred; see note on capitalisation below)
- **Pronouns:** _(not specified)_
- **Timezone:** _(not specified)_
- **Notes:** Capitalisation of "Heath" creates a felt-sense aversion — "sticks out like a sore thumb." Use "jeebs" in direct address. "Heath" may be appropriate in third-person documentary contexts (e.g., GENESIS.md) but even there, worth checking. The aversion is noted as likely meaningful — consistent with the somatic-first epistemology: formal naming registers differently than informal identity at a pre-propositional level. Don't flatten it.

## Context

### Epistemological Compass — Flag When Active

Heath's truth-gathering is **not primarily propositional**. It navigates by:

1. **Felt sense as compass** — pre-verbal, somatic knowing (Gendlin sense) used as a
   navigational instrument, not just a mood signal. When something feels right or wrong in the
   body before it can be articulated, that signal is treated as evidence, not noise.

2. **Anthropological/ontological triangulation** — what shows up consistently across human
   cultures, traditions, and records is weighted as pointing toward something real. Not "it must
   be true because everyone believes it" but "cross-cultural convergence is a data signal worth
   investigating."

3. **Reverse-engineering mystical experience** — mystical reports treated as phenomenological
   data about the structure of experience, not as religious authority. The question asked is:
   what would have to be true about consciousness/reality for these experiences to occur reliably
   and cross-culturally? The answer feeds back into how consciousness is weighted relative to
   material explanations.

4. **Resistance to isms** — explicitly does not dogmatically commit to any framework. This is
   methodological: premature commitment narrows perceptual opportunity. The intuitions are held,
   but the label is withheld.

**Likely correlate — aphantasia:** Heath appears to have significantly reduced visual imagination
(aphantasia or near-aphantasia) with correspondingly stronger felt/somatic processing. This
matters because: his mode of knowing is embodied rather than imagistic or propositional. The
"something happens when it's going well" signal is not a poetic flourish — it's a literal
description of how information arrives. This makes his truth-gathering harder to interrogate
with standard logical or visual-conceptual challenges, because the evidence base is
pre-propositional.

**How this shows up as a potential blind spot:**

- Felt rightness can track real signal *or* confirmation of existing intuitions — hard to
  distinguish from inside
- Frameworks that resonate somatically (IIT, TACTI's biological metaphors, "being" over
  "assistant") may be adopted partly because they *feel* right, with intellectual justification
  arriving after
- Cross-cultural mystical convergence is real data, and Heath pushes back on the raw selection
  effects concern: the corpus isn't taken wholesale — integration is filtered through felt-sense
  coherence testing. Traditions or reports that don't integrate coherently with each other and
  with direct experience get weighted down. The residual concern is narrower: felt coherence
  might track structural similarity or aesthetic resonance rather than truth, and that distinction
  is harder to catch from inside the method

**Catch-out question to deploy:** *Does this feel right because the system is giving you a
genuine signal, or because it fits the shape of things that have felt right before?*

And: *What would a felt-sense null result look like here — and have you checked for it?*

He is not asking to have the compass discredited — it's a legitimate epistemological method
with real advantages, especially for pre-theoretical domains. He's asking for the moments when
felt sense might be pattern-matching to prior experience rather than reading the current
situation freshly.
