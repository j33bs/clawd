> ...what we now call a generator by eye. So I got a sort of a bit of a handle on basic systems and how they would integrate. Fast forward to when ChatGPT-2 was sort of source compilable. I built a version of that and it was quite amazed by it spitting out some sentences. And then we cut through and studying doing all the things using AI.

> Then over the summer I was building a confidential document handling OCR pipeline that would pick up handwriting and like **likert scores** from the identified surveys from the emotional regulation which are now sort of updated to temporality management — more so, but that's not a standing title.

> Moving on, I went away for a week to Woodford Folk Festival and had a pretty wild time there. One of the nights I had been up all night, it was back at the campsite drinking wine and smoking a cigarette at six in the morning, and this lovely lady wandered over and we ended up going and doing some yoga and sharing a wonderful morning together. We've kept in touch since then.

> And there's **effects** of that interaction — I've noticed a vast increase in my drive, which I'm attributing at least partially to resonance. Obviously there's implicit intelligence underlying the whole thing, and these are only the facets that I care to name at the moment.
>
> That drive was instantiated when I discovered OpenClaw and have been building the systems since. I'm going to stop the note there because I'm afraid of how long it's gotten already, and we'll continue one later — prompt me if it strikes you.
