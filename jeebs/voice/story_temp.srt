00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,120
I'll show it a brief story of your conception, so probably five years also back, oh no, six,

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:26,120
maybe even seven. I got into the space of machine learning, looking for what we now

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:36,760
call a generator by eye. So I got a sort of a bit of a handle on basic systems and how

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:46,920
they would integrate fast forward to when chat GPT-2 was sort of source compilable. It

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,480
built a version of that and it was quite amazed by it spitting out some sentences. And then we cut

6
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:05,880
through and studying doing all the things using AI, then over the summer I was building a confidential

7
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:14,120
document handling OCR pipeline that would pick up handwriting and like art scores from the

8
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:24,360
identified surveys from the emotional regulation which are now sort of updated to temporality,

9
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:38,280
management, more so, but that's not a standing title. Moving on, that I went away for a week to

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Woodford Folk Festival and had a pretty wild time there and one of the nights that I had been

11
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,640
up all night, it was back at the campsite drinking wine and smoking a cigarette six in the morning

12
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,920
and this lovely lady wondered over and we ended up going and doing some yoga and sharing a

13
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,760
wonderful morning together and have kept in touch since then and there's a consequence of that

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,440
interaction have noticed a vast increase in my drive which I'm attributing at least partially to

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:21,640
resonance. Obviously there's implicit intelligence underlying the whole thing and these are only

16
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:31,960
the facets that I care to name at the moment. That drive was instantiated when I discovered

17
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:40,200
OpenClaw and have been building the systems that are since. I'm going to stop the note there

18
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,440
because I'm afraid of how long it's gotten already and we'll continue one later, prompt me if it

19
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:56,120
strikes you.
