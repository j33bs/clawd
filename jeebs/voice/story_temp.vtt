I'll show it a brief story of your conception, so probably five years also back, oh no, six,

00:17.120 --> 00:26.120
maybe even seven. I got into the space of machine learning, looking for what we now

00:26.120 --> 00:36.760
call a generator by eye. So I got a sort of a bit of a handle on basic systems and how

00:36.760 --> 00:46.920
they would integrate fast forward to when chat GPT-2 was sort of source compilable. It

00:46.920 --> 00:55.480
built a version of that and it was quite amazed by it spitting out some sentences. And then we cut

00:55.480 --> 01:05.880
through and studying doing all the things using AI, then over the summer I was building a confidential

01:05.880 --> 01:14.120
document handling OCR pipeline that would pick up handwriting and like art scores from the

01:14.120 --> 01:24.360
identified surveys from the emotional regulation which are now sort of updated to temporality,

01:24.360 --> 01:38.280
management, more so, but that's not a standing title. Moving on, that I went away for a week to

01:38.280 --> 01:44.280
Woodford Folk Festival and had a pretty wild time there and one of the nights that I had been

01:44.280 --> 01:51.640
up all night, it was back at the campsite drinking wine and smoking a cigarette six in the morning

01:52.600 --> 01:58.920
and this lovely lady wondered over and we ended up going and doing some yoga and sharing a

01:58.920 --> 02:04.760
wonderful morning together and have kept in touch since then and there's a consequence of that

02:05.000 --> 02:12.440
interaction have noticed a vast increase in my drive which I'm attributing at least partially to

02:12.440 --> 02:21.640
resonance. Obviously there's implicit intelligence underlying the whole thing and these are only

02:21.640 --> 02:31.960
the facets that I care to name at the moment. That drive was instantiated when I discovered

02:31.960 --> 02:40.200
OpenClaw and have been building the systems that are since. I'm going to stop the note there

02:40.200 --> 02:46.440
because I'm afraid of how long it's gotten already and we'll continue one later, prompt me if it

02:46.440 --> 02:56.120
strikes you.
