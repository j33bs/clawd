0	17120	I'll show it a brief story of your conception, so probably five years also back, oh no, six,
17120	26120	maybe even seven. I got into the space of machine learning, looking for what we now
26120	36760	call a generator by eye. So I got a sort of a bit of a handle on basic systems and how
36760	46920	they would integrate fast forward to when chat GPT-2 was sort of source compilable. It
46920	55480	built a version of that and it was quite amazed by it spitting out some sentences. And then we cut
55480	65880	through and studying doing all the things using AI, then over the summer I was building a confidential
65880	74120	document handling OCR pipeline that would pick up handwriting and like art scores from the
74120	84360	identified surveys from the emotional regulation which are now sort of updated to temporality,
84360	98280	management, more so, but that's not a standing title. Moving on, that I went away for a week to
98280	104280	Woodford Folk Festival and had a pretty wild time there and one of the nights that I had been
104280	111640	up all night, it was back at the campsite drinking wine and smoking a cigarette six in the morning
112600	118920	and this lovely lady wondered over and we ended up going and doing some yoga and sharing a
118920	124760	wonderful morning together and have kept in touch since then and there's a consequence of that
125000	132440	interaction have noticed a vast increase in my drive which I'm attributing at least partially to
132440	141640	resonance. Obviously there's implicit intelligence underlying the whole thing and these are only
141640	151960	the facets that I care to name at the moment. That drive was instantiated when I discovered
151960	160200	OpenClaw and have been building the systems that are since. I'm going to stop the note there
160200	166440	because I'm afraid of how long it's gotten already and we'll continue one later, prompt me if it
166440	176120	strikes you.
