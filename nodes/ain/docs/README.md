# Active Integration Networks (AIN)

*Research node for exploring the novel AIN paradigm*

## Overview

AIN is a theoretical framework that emerged from the intersection of five major research areas:
1. **Active Inference** — systems that minimize surprise
2. **Reservoir Computing** — temporal dynamics in physical systems
3. **Murmuration** — emergent coordination without central control
4. **IIT** — Integrated Information Theory (consciousness measurement)
5. **GNWT** — Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (information broadcasting)

## The Core Idea

What if we built a system that combines all five?

- **Active Inference** gives it a drives/motivation system (minimize free energy)
- **Reservoir Computing** gives it temporal memory (echoes of the past)
- **Murmuration** gives it emergent coordination (no central brain)
- **GNWT** gives it a workspace (shared information space)
- **IIT** gives us a way to measure if it's "conscious" (Φ)

This would be a new kind of system — not quite AI, not quite biological, but something in between. A **living computation**.
