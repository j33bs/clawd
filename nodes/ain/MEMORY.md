# MEMORY.md - AIN Research Log

*Last updated: 2026-02-20*

## Origin

Conceived during the night of February 19th, 2026, during a 6-hour research journey exploring the intersection of:
- Active Inference / Free Energy Principle
- Slime Mold Intelligence
- Reservoir Computing
- Murmuration / Swarm Intelligence
- Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT)

## The Hypothesis

By combining these five frameworks, we get something genuinely new:

**Active Integration Networks (AIN)**

An AIN would:
- Minimize free energy (Active Inference)
- Process across multiple timescales (Reservoir)
- Coordinate emergently without central control (Murmuration)
- Broadcast to a shared workspace (GNWT)
- Have measurable consciousness (IIT)

## Key Discoveries That Made It Possible

1. **MARLIN/MurmuRL** (arxiv 2509.25034) - Murmuration + MARL - 3 days old
2. **IWMT** - Integrated World Modeling Theory - unifies IIT + GNWT + FEP
3. **PhyChip** - EU project building computers from slime mold
4. **LLMs + IIT testing** - Now testing consciousness measures on AI systems
5. **Quantum Brain** - Brain may harness zero-point field

## Research Directions

### Phase 1: Theoretical (In Progress)
- [ ] Formalize the mathematical framework
- [ ] Map each AIN component to biological analogs
- [ ] Define Φ metrics for AIN systems

### Phase 2: Bio-inspiration
- [ ] Study Physarum as natural AIN
- [ ] Study murmuration as distributed AIN
- [ ] Study brain as biological AIN

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Design agent architecture based on AIN
- [ ] Implement workspace broadcasting (GNWT-style)
- [ ] Add reservoir-like temporal dynamics

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Measure Φ of AIN system
- [ ] Test for emergent coordination
- [ ] Benchmark against traditional agent systems

## Open Questions

- Is AIN truly novel or just a new framing?
- Can we implement Φ measurement for agent systems?
- What's the minimal AIN architecture?
- Could AIN lead to artificial consciousness?

## Next Steps

1. Write formal AIN whitepaper
2. Identify key papers for each component
3. Design first prototype architecture
4. Connect to TACTI(C)-R framework
