# AIN node scaffold (tracked)

Purpose: governed scaffold for AIN-related agent definitions/research artifacts.

Tracked:
- Textual docs/config/fixtures required for reproducible behavior.

Not tracked:
- Runtime logs, sessions, caches, event streams (must live under workspace/ or be ignored).

Invariants:
- No secrets.
- Deterministic fixtures where feasible.
- Changes require audit note when behavioral.
