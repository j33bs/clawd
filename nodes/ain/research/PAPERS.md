## Notes from Research Journey

### IWMT (Integrated World Modeling Theory)
- Combines IIT + GNWT + FEP + Active Inference
- Goal: solve the "hard problem" of consciousness
- TACTI(C)-R already incorporates all four frameworks!

### HTM + Hardware Acceleration
- Accelerated HTM (AHTM) - 8x faster
- Direct mapping to TEMPORALITY principle
- Sleep = memory consolidation = predictive coding

### Key Question
- Can we implement Φ measurement for agent systems?
- What's the minimal AIN architecture?
- Could AIN lead to artificial consciousness?
