# C_Lawd Memory (Canonical System-2)

This file is the canonical long-term memory root for node `c_lawd`.

Migration policy (one cycle):
- Legacy references to `system2` / `system-2` are normalized to `c_lawd`.
- Existing System-2 evidence and governance docs remain valid and are not deleted immediately.
